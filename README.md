# Eclipedia - README

## Team Name
- Team Name: Area 51

## Problem Statement
- Eclipses are awe-inspiring celestial events that drastically change the appearance of one of the two biggest objects we see in our sky: our Sun and Moon. On Earth, people can experience eclipses when Earth, the Moon, and the Sun align. Your challenge is to create a game, activity, or story for young learners that explains the mechanics of eclipses, including eclipse seasons, how and why eclipses occur, and why only some people on Earth can see an eclipse at a given time.

## A Brief of the Prototype
Eclipedia is an interactive website designed to educate users about eclipses. It offers the following features:

- *Interactive Simulator*: Allows users to simulate eclipses.
- *VR Functionality*: Offers a virtual reality experience of eclipses from the user's perspective.
- *Chatbot*: Provides answers to user queries about eclipses.
- *Facts About Eclipses*: Presents interesting facts about eclipses.
- *Quiz*: Tests users on what they have learned about eclipses.
